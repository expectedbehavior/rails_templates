INSTALLATION
------------
Clone this and run:
 /path/to/this/repo/run.rb app_name

DO NOT RUN THIS FROM GITHUB. IT WILL NOT WORK.


WHAT DO YOU GET?
----------------
General
* bundler setup
* lots of good plugins and gems you'll probably want (see below)
* no annoying removing of the default files in public
* a reasonably thorough .gitignore
* password filtering enabled in logs
* usernames and strong default passwords for your envs
* setup your mysql socket with the one we find on your system
* your db initialized and ready for use
* getexceptional setup and ready to be used
* scaffolded user, authentication, and routing for those, with views in haml and a cucumber test to make sure they work
* culerity setup for immediate use
* some really sweet step definitions for your cucumber tests
* everything is committed to a new local git repo!
* a pretty starting point alike to - http://www.transdmin.perspectived.com/

Plugins installed
* production_data - adds a script to manage your environments' databases
* bootstrapper - awesome db data loading helper
* jrails - jquery for rails
* cucumber_culerity_step_definitions - cooler step definitions
* rcov_rails - easy rcov action (run with rake test:coverage)

Gems of note installed
(for a full list, see templates/Gemfile)
* authlogic - authentication
* haml - awesome templating
* factory_girl - create data for testing via factory instead of fixture
* cucumber - testing framework of doooom
* cucumber-rails - testing framerwork helper of doooom
* culerity - wrapper for jruby's celerity
* celerity - integration test with js support (built on htmlunit)(installed under jruby)
* database_cleaner - used by cucumber to do some stuff with active_record

Misc installed
* jruby - we want to control the version

Gems required
* bundler

Caveats
* We use mysql, so this is built with that in mind, though it's not required.
* we install jruby into the project directly for use with culerity.  This means installing will take a while, and your project is going to be really big when you clone it
* Our test setup is pretty non-standard.  You should really check out cucumber_culerity and understand what it does before you run this.
* You will need to have java 1.5 installed (for now).

HOW DO I KNOW IT WORKED?
------------------------
After the app is done installing, run the following at the command line:
 rake
