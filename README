INSTALLATION
------------
Clone this and run:
rails -m /path/to/this/repo/base.rb
-OR-
run it from github:
rails -m http://github.com/expectedbehavior/rails_templates/raw/master/base.rb


WHAT DO YOU GET?
----------------
General
* frozen copy of rails
* lots of good plugins and gems you'll probably want (see below)
* no annoying removing of the default files in public
* a reasonably thorough .gitignore
* password filtering enabled in logs
* usernames and strong default passwords for your envs
* setup your mysql socket with the one we find on your system
* your db initialized and ready for use
* exception notification setup and ready to be used (see Caveats)
* scaffolded user, authentication, and routing for those, with views in haml and a cucumber test to make sure they work
* culerity setup for immediate use
* some really sweet step definitions for your cucumber tests
* everything is committed to a new local git repo!

Plugins installed
* db_setup - adds a script to manage your environments' databases
* authlogic - authentication
* haml - awesome templating
* exception_notification - email yourself when something bad happens in your app
* bootstrapper - awesome db data loading helper
* culerity - wrapper for jruby's celerity

Gems installed
* factory_girl - create data for testing via factory instead of fixture
* cucumber - testing framework of doooom
* cucumber-rails - testing framerwork helper of doooom
* celerity - integration test with js support (built on htmlunit)(installed under jruby)

Misc installed
* jruby - we want to control the version

Gems required
* pwfoo - password generation
* highline/import - terminal interaction

Caveats
* We use mysql, so this is built with that in mind.
* Exception notifier is setup to email our company.  You probably don't want that!
* we install jruby into the project directly for use with culerity.  This means installing will take a while, and your project is going to be really big when you clone it
* Our test setup is pretty non-standard.  You should really check out cucumber_culerity and understand what it does before you run this.
* You will need to have java 1.5 installed (for now).
* You'll need to have gemcutter setup as a gem source.

HOW DO I KNOW IT WORKED?

After the app is done installing, run the following at the command line:
